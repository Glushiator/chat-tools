# AI Geo-Timestamp

**A privacy-first, mobile-friendly web app for quick, accurate timestamp + location snippets—perfect for journaling, AI chat context, or personal recordkeeping.**

---

## Features

- **One-tap Timestamp & Location:**  
  Instantly copies a friendly, timestamped string with your current street address or a named saved location to the clipboard.
  
- **Address Lookup:**  
  Uses OpenStreetMap for fast, free reverse geocoding—no API keys needed.

- **Smart Saved Locations:**  
  Save common places (e.g., Home, Office). When you’re nearby (±100m), the app uses your label instead of an address for privacy and clarity.

- **Dark Mode:**  
  Sleek toggle for day or night use. Preference is remembered.

- **Export / Import Locations:**  
  Backup or transfer your saved locations as a simple JSON file—easy, secure, no cloud required.

- **Privacy-respecting:**  
  All data stays local to your device. Only the address lookup uses the internet, and that’s via free, public OSM APIs.

## How To Use

1. **Open `index.html` in your browser** (mobile or desktop).
2. **Press “Copy Timestamp & Location”:**  
   - If near a saved place, you’ll get e.g., `[Fri, Jul 4, 2025, 3:32 PM at Home]`  
   - Otherwise, you’ll get `[Fri, Jul 4, 2025, 3:32 PM at 123 Main St, Springfield...]`
   - The result is instantly copied to your clipboard—paste anywhere!
3. **Manage Saved Locations:**  
   - Add a label (e.g., “Home”), hit “Save Current Location” to store.
   - Export/Import lets you move your list between devices.
4. **Toggle Dark Mode:**  
   - Use the top-right switch to match your preference.
